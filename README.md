# no
---

Returns the string 'n' very quickly.


## to use

Build with a compiler like GCC:

	gcc no.c -o no
	

Then copy or symlink to /usr/bin/no (or somewhere else in your path).


#### but why? doesn't 'yes' take a command line argument and return that?  doesn't that already do what this program does?

yes.
